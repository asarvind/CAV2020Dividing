We evaluate our intersection of unions method on three examples, i.e.,
1) The illustrative Example~\ref{eg:ill} 2) A seven dimensional model
of autonomous car with one input proposed in~ 3) A twelve dimensional
model of quadrotor from ARCH workshop~.  For the illustrative example,
we compare the flowpipe accuracy of our method with that of only
\emph{union of zonotopes} based on the performance index in
Equation~\ref{eqn:pi} proposed by Althoff
et.al.~\cite{althoff2008reachability} .  On the other two real world
examples, besides the performance index~(\ref{eqn:pi}), we compare our
method with state-of-the-art methods, i.e., polynomial
zonotopes in CORA and Taylor models in Flowstar.  We obtained a high
increase in flowpipe accurary compared to other methods.
