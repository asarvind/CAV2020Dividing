We propose a new efficient way of piecewise linearization based
flowpipe computation for uncertain nonlinear ODEs.  Piecewise
linearization suffers from exponential blowup in the number of pieces
in high dimensional state space.  Alternatively, if the number of
divisions is fixed, we need to optimize the way the reach set is
divided to minimize the linearization error. A previous method in
literature proposed to minimize a scalar measure of linearization
error while dividing the reachable sets, which does not necessarily
reduce the linearization error along all coordinates.  In this paper,
we propose a better method where we use multiple best optimal ways of
division, instead of a single way of division, for minimizing
linearization error along multiple directions.  Consequently, we
represent reachable sets as the intersection of unions
(IoU), where each intersecting union corresponds to the optimized
division for each direction among multiple directions.  As a proof of
concept, we evaluate our method on an illustrative example and two
high dimensional real-world examples.  We demonstrate a high increase
in the flowpipe accuracy compared to the earlier method of division
and other state-of-the-art methods.
