We propose a new efficient method for computing over approximation of
set of trajectories, called flowpipe, for a system described by
nonlinear differential equations.  Since reachable sets of linear
systems can be computed efficiently, piecewise linearization of
nonlinear ODEs is a commonly used while computing flowpipes.  But the
number of pieces required in piecewise linearization becomes
exponential in the dimension for minimizing linearization error below
any threshold value, which can be computationally intractable in high
dimensions.  Alternatively, we can fix the number of divisions, in
which case we need to optimize the way reach set is divided to
minimize the linearization error.  Since the linearization error is
multi-dimensional, this minimization is a multi-objective optimization
problem which does not have a single best solution.  However, an
previous method in literature proposed to minimize a single
dimensional measure while dividing the reachable sets, which does not
necessarily reduce the linearization error along all coordinates.  In
this paper, we propose a better method where we use multiple best
optimal ways of division, instead of a single way of division, for
minimizing linearization error along multiple directions.
Subsequently, we represent the resulting reachable sets as
intersection of unions (IoU), where each intersecting union
corresponds to the optimized division for each direction among
multiple directions.  We propose an algorithm to propogate the
resulting IoU of sets for flowpipe computation.  This way, we ensure
that the linearization error along is reduced significantly along
every direction is a set of multiple directions.  We evaluate our
algorithm on an illustrative example and two high dimensional real
world examples.  We demonstrate high increase in accuracy compared to
the earlier method of division and also other state-of-the-art methods
for flowpipe computation of nonlinear systems.
